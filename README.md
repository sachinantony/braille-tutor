#Interactive Braile Tutor

This is a device that can be used to train blind students in Braile script. The instructor will use a webcam to take the picture of a text document. The image processing algorithm will parse the text from the image and send it to the student unit, which will use solenoids for generating Braile characters. So the idea is that the teacher will just take a picture of the text and all the students can read the text with their Braille generation units. This will save a lot of time as the teacher need not got every student to explain show him the script.

The image processing logic is implemented using Matlab and embedded C is used for the coding in the students' unit.
